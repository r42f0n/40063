Module   Learning Outcomes:
This assignment   is designed to assess the following   module   learning   outcomes.   Your   submission will   be   marked   using the Grading Criteria given   in the   section   below.
•             Portfolio Analysis and Optimization: Students will   be able to   perform   portfolio   optimization      using Stata, demonstrating   proficiency   in the   practical application of financial econometrics to   construct portfolios that meet specific   risk-return criteria,   including the   Global   Minimum Variance   Portfolio and the Optimal   Risky   Portfolio.
•             Critical   Evaluation of Financial   Models:   Develop the ability to critically   analyse   and
interpret the results from financial models such as   the   CAPM,   assessing   their   implications   in   the real-world setting of financial markets   and   institutions.
•             Data Analysis Skills: Gain   hands-on experience in   handling   real-world   data   by   downloading,   analysing, and   interpreting financial data from sources   like Yahoo   Finance, using tools to   compute descriptive statistics, correlations, and regression analyses   pertinent   to financial   markets.
•             Communication of Financial Analysis:   Enhance the ability to clearly   articulate financial   analysis and recommendations through structured reporting,   including the   proper   presentation of statistical data, graphs, and   investment strategies   in a   professional   report   format.
Project   Report
1          Introduction
●   Your report should show the optimal   allocation of   assets   (risk-free   and   risky   assets)   based   on   the   optimizations.
●   Choose   five   companies   of your   choice,   making   up   your   portfolio.
●   This   is   an   individual   project   so   I   expect   that   you   work   independently.      Please   do   not   choose the same portfolios or   report   very   similar   comments;   any   cooperative   work   will   be penalised.
●   You   must   upload   TWO   files   on   Canvas:
1.   Your   report   in   Word   or   PDF   format.
2.   The   Stata   do   file   so   that   I   can   replicate   your   results.
●   The report should not exceed   750   words; tables   and   graphs   are   not   included   in   the   word   count.   Please   include   the   word   count   at   the   top   of your   document.   A   penalty   of 5
●   The   report   counts   for   25%   of the   final   mark.
●   The   deadline   for   submitting   the   project   is   clearly   indicated   on   Canvas   and   on   the   remit.
2          Report   Organization
●   You   should   analyze   your   data   using    Stata.       During    Week    6,    which    is    the    assessment   support   week,   the   lecture   will   focus   on   preparing   for   the   project.   A   ”do   file”   containing necessary   commands,   along   with   a   recording   of the   Week   6   lecture   that   explains   how   to execute   these   commands,   will   be   available   on   Canvas   in   the   ’Project’   section.
●   The   rep代 写40063 LM Economics of Financial Markets and InstitutionsR
代做程序编程语言ort   that   you   submit   should   be   organized   as   a   literate   response   to   the   questions,   divided   in   paragraphs   that   can   be   understood   by   someone   who   didn’t   just   read   the   questions.
●   Include   your   basic   numerical   results   and   graphs   in   your   paragraphs   along   with   the   ap-   propriate   analysis   and   interpretation   of   them.
●   Providing   solely   the   calculations   is    NOT    acceptable.       A    discussion    of    your    findings,   comparisons   of   the   results,   possible   explanations   for   any   differences   found,   and   finally   your   recommendations   for   an   investor   wanting   to   hold   this   portfolio   are   essential.
●   Please   edit   tables   and   graphs   from   Stata   before   inserting   them   in   the   document.


●   Tables   and graphs should be numbered,   have   a   meaningful   title,   and   an   explanatory   note   at   the   bottom.
●   The   significance   level   of   the   coefficients   must   be   indicated   with   an   asterisk   next   to   the   coefficient,   according   to   the   significance   level:   *   10%,   **   5%,   ***   1%.
3          Points   to   Discuss   in   the   Report
1.    Download   monthly   prices,   from   January   2014   through   December   2023,   on   the   market   as   a   whole   and   on   five   individual   stocks   (for   different   industries)   of your   choice   from Yahoo   Finance.   Briefly   describe   the   stocks   that   you   have   selected.
2.    Graph   the   time   series   of the   prices.
3.    Compute   the   returns   using   the   closing   prices:


rt = ln (Pt−1/Pt)   × 100
4.    Compute   descriptive   statistics   (mean,   standard   deviation,   maximum,   and   minimum)   of   the   returns   and   report   them   in   a   table.
5.    Look   at   the   correlation   and   report   the   results   in   a   table   with   the   significance   levels.
6.    Get   the   frequency   histograms   of your   returns.
7.    Estimate   and   plot   the   linear   relationship   between   each   of   your   assets’   returns   and   the   market   returns.
8.   Estimate   the   CAPM   (reporting   the   results   in   a   table):
E(˜(r)j   ) = rf    +   βj      [E(˜(r)M   ) −   rf   ]
The   annual   risk-free   rate   is   2.4%.
9.    Compute   the   following   portfolios   and   report   them   in   a   table   (one   portfolio   per   column) indicating   the   weights, the   expected   return   of   the   portfolio, the   standard   deviation   of   the portfolio,   and   the   Sharpe   ratio:
●   The   Global   Minimum   Variance   Portfolio   (GMVP), i.e., the   portfolio   that   lies   to   the far   left   of   the   efficient   frontier   and   is   made   up   of   a   portfolio   of   risky   assets   that   produces   the   minimum   risk   for   an   investor.
●   Compute   four   portfolios:   three   choosing   appropriate   increments   of the   required   re-   turn   above   the   GMVP   and   one   with   the   maximum   return.
●   The   optimal   risky   portfolio,   i.e.,   the   one   at   tangency   between   the   efficient   frontier   and   the   capital   market   line.
10.   Plot   the   efficient   frontier   on   a   return-risk   diagram   for   a   long-only   constraint,   not   for long-short   (where   short   selling   is   permitted).
11.   Plot   the   optimal   risky   portfolio   tangent   to   the   capital   market   line.      Do   so   for   both   a long-only   constraint   .
